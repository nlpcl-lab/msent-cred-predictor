# Cache

This is a folder for cached files.
The caches will be made for every bert model & (test, train) set.
They also will be made with the python module _Pickle_.

For example: `cached_bert-base-multilingual-cased_train.pkl`

The file above contains train set, tokenized by pretrained _bert-base-multilingual_ model.
